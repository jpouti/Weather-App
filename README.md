# Weather-App

Weather App is a project to build a weather forecast web page with Javascript. Project is part of The Odin Project Javascript [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app).

Live [demo](https://jpouti.github.io/Weather-App/)

Main goal for this exercise project is to get familiar with APIs and to get comfortable with promises & async and await.

Weather App is showing the current weather of a location from user input, and a random GIF related to the weather condition in selected location. User has also an option to look for 7 day weather forecast from selected location. Weather data is possible to be displayed as Celsius (by default) or Fahrenheit.

Used API's:

 - [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
 - [Giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/)

Improvements & updates:

  - Main focus of the project has been on the page content, currently the styling is rather simple and could be updated
  - Add weather alerts for the selected location
